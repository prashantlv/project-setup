# project-setup
Python script to automate the project initialization process.

I do the following steps:

    1. Create a directory for the project
    2. Create and initialize a git repository
    3. Push this directory onto git repository
    4 .Open this project directory in VS Code

And repeating these same steps for every project is boring, so I made a Python and a shell script that would do all these steps with only one command.
